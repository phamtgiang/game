    - In this assignment, we must complete three problem (N-Puzzle, Sudoku, Finding path) relate to 
    search algorithm and informed algorithm (Depth First Search, Genetic Algorithm, A* Algorithm).
    - Environment : python 3.8
    - Implemented problem at least three file (include README.md).
    - Comment , explain clearly each function in each file.
    -  Problems can be formulated as a problem as follows:
        - 'State'
        - 'Initial State'
        - 'Goal State'
        - 'Legal moves'
        - 'Heuristic Function'
## SUDOKU
    
### Implementation
    - Implement SUDOKU based on Genetic Algorithm.
### Compile and run
* random input.
    - python main.py 
* test.
    - python main.py input.txt
### Result
    - Solution of SUDOKU (including all steps)
